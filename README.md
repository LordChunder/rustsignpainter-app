## Download & Installation

1. Navigate to the [Releases](https://github.com/LordChunder/rustsignpainter-app/releases) tab on the right side of this
   GitHub page.
2. Under the **Latest** release, download the `rsp.exe` file.
3. Run the `.exe` (No installation required).

*Note: Windows Defender or other antivirus software may flag the file because it uses mouse/keyboard automation. This is
normal behavior for macro tools.*

## Free vs. Pro Tier

Rust Sign Painter is free to download and use forever, but the free tier has built-in limitations. Upgrading to Pro
unlocks the full potential of the rendering engine for highly detailed, photorealistic signs.

| Feature            | Free Tier      | Pro Tier             |
|:-------------------|:---------------|:---------------------|
| **Max Colors**     | Up to 8 Colors | **Up to 64 Colors**  |
| **Hardware Delay** | Capped at 50ms | **Unlimited (0ms)**  |
| **Color Delay**    | Capped at 0.5s | **Unlimited (0.0s)** |
| **Updates**        | Basic          | **Priority**         |

### How to Upgrade to Pro

1. Purchase a lifetime license key at *
   *[awaiteddevelopments.com/rustsignpainter](https://www.awaiteddevelopments.com/rustsignpainter)**.
2. Open the application.
3. Click **Options → 🔑 Activate License...** in the top menu bar.
4. Enter your email and license key to instantly unlock Pro features.

*Note: Licenses are limited to one active device per user and can be transferred. Multiple devices simultaneously
require separate licenses.*

## Disclaimer & Safety

This tool uses mouse and keyboard automation **only after you explicitly start painting**.  
Always test on low-value signs first. Facepunch has commented that sign painting tools will not result in anti-cheat
bans, though you use this at your own risk.
